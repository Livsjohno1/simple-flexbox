      <p>Forget-me-not is valued for its attractive flowers. While the blooms are usually blue, other colors do exist. A bonus feature is that the buds preceding the blooms are pink, so you get two colors for the price of one. These plants are herbs historically used as an astringent to treat wounds and some medical conditions</p>
